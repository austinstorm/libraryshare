LIBRARY SHARE
=================

A replacement for byzantine OPACs focused on people, not holdings. Your patrons are more important than your marc records.

Right now it's only a mock-up. Version 0.1.0 will be a working prototype.

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, Libraryshare will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
